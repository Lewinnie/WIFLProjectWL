)
```

My goal for this project is to learn the functions of R and use it to manipulate and analyze the WIFL dataset. 

```{r}
library(readr)
WIFL_Metadata <- read_csv("~/Desktop/WIFLProject/WIFL_Metadata.csv")
panel1 <- read_delim("~/Desktop/WIFLProject/panel1.csv", 
    "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
WIFLPanel1 <- WIFL_Metadata %>% left_join(panel1, by = "Field_Number")
library(readr)
panel2 <- read_delim("~/Desktop/WIFLProject/panel2.csv", 
    "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
WIFLPanel1_2 <- WIFLPanel1 %>% left_join(panel2, by = "Field_Number")
```
